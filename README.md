# Volume Rendering using dynamic preview galleries in WebGL

This was the project of my bachelor thesis (B.Sc. Computational Visualistics). 
A set of 256 medical CT images is rendered to a 3D-Model using raycasting techniques.
The projects is written using JavaScript and WebGL, especially the Three.js library. 

To explore the volume data, preview galleries are created dynamically.
This should make the exploration of volume data more accessible for novice users.

**Currently only running in Chrome. Better activate your hardware acceleration.**
